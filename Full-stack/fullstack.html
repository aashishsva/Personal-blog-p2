    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>Full Stack Web Development refers to the practice of working on both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) of web applications. A full stack developer is a professional who is capable of handling both of these aspects seamlessly. They work on everything from databases to UI/UX design, as well as server management and APIs.</p>

        <h2>Technologies Involved</h2>
        <h3>Front-End (Client-Side)</h3>
        <p>The front-end is the part of the website that users interact with. The main technologies used for front-end development are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML:</strong> The structure of the website, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, and buttons.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS:</strong> The style of the website, including layout, colors, fonts, and design.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> The behavior of the website, such as interactive elements, animations, and dynamic content updates.</li>
            <li><strong>Front-End Frameworks:</strong> Libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js that simplify and organize JavaScript development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Back-End (Server-Side)</h3>
        <p>The back-end is the server-side of the application, responsible for database interactions, server logic, and performance. The main technologies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Server Languages:</strong> Programming languages like Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, or Java that power the back-end logic.</li>
            <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Storage systems like MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or SQLite that hold data for the application.</li>
            <li><strong>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):</strong> These are used to interact with other services, fetch data, or handle user requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Server Frameworks:</strong> Tools like Express.js (Node.js), Django (Python), and Laravel (PHP) that make server-side coding easier.</li>
        </ul>
